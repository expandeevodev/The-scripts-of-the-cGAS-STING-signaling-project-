The cGAS-STING signaling has emerged as a pivotal component of innate immunity for both foreign- and self-DNA detection, the activity of which must be tightly fine-tuned to allow adequate host defense while avoiding over-activation or the inappropriate self-DNA sensing induced untoward consequences. The cGAS-STING signaling also plays important roles in various noninfectious contexts, including cancer, aging, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of the cGAS-STING signaling mediated regulation, characterizing gene expression profile is a fundamental step. Here, we performed RNA-seq experiments to measure transcriptomic profiling mediated by the cGAS-STING signaling in human and mouse cells. By treating cells with three well-established cGAS-STING signaling stimulators (cGAMP, G3-YSD and HT-DNA) and one DNA virus (HSV-1) in replicates, the resulting over 1 billion high quality reads provided rich resources to comprehensively measure conserved and species-specific changes of protein-coding genes, lncRNAs and alternative splicing events genome-widely. This dataset will be useful for improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cGAS-STING signaling mediated numerous physiological and pathological processes.
This port includes the relevant codes used to produce the results showing in the paper, including reads quality control, reads mapping, gene quatification, transcriptome assembly, protein-coding potencial estimation, novel lncRNA prediction and known and novel splicing junction identification.
